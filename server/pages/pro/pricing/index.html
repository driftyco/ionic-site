  <ul class="items left">
    <li class="item">
      <h4 id="faq-live-deploy">What is a live deploy?</h4>
      <p>
        Using the Ionic Deploy service allows you to push hot code updates to
        devices running your apps directly from the Ionic Pro dashboard, without
        having to go through the App Stores. This is limited by monthly active
        users of your app. If you need more, contact our <a href="/sales">sales
        team</a> and we’ll make sure the platform scales to meet your needs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4 id="faq-error-monitoring">What is error monitoring?</h4>
      <p>
        Ionic Monitor provides error catching and stack trace capabilities so
        you can identify errors and pinpoint the portions of your code that
        require updates. The Kickstarter plan offers limited error monitoring
        with 100 events per month included for free. Starting with the Developer
        plan, we offer advanced error monitoring with unlimited event tracking.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4 id="faq-channel">What is a channel?</h4>
      <p>
        A Channel points to a specific build of your app that will be shared
        with specific testers and users. You can change which build a Channel
        points to whenever you'd like, and can rollback changes as well.
        Channels are used for both Ionic View and Ionic Deploy. See below for
        more detail.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4 id="faq-difference">What’s the difference between Developer, Business, and Enterprise?</h4>
      <p>
        Our paid plans offer varying levels of services and usage limits that
        are designed to meet the needs of different audiences. The Developer
        plan is ideal for serious app builders looking to accelerate development
        and build higher quality apps.  The Business plan offers a complete app
        building platform for teams and organizations working collaboratively or
        with larger scale apps.  Finally, the Enterprise plan is targeted at
        larger organizations that want the peace of mind of additional support
        services and training, simplified licensing and custom billing.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul class="items right">
    <li class="item">
      <h4 id="faq-view-sharing">How does public and private sharing with the View App work?</h4>
      <p>
        The Ionic View App is the easiest way to get your app in the hands of
        testers and collaborators. Starting with the Developer plan, apps are
        private by default and can be shared via a simple email invite. With the
        Kickstarter plan, apps are publicly accessible. You can invite testers
        simply by sharing the App Id and inviting them to download the View App.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4 id="faq-split-testing">What is split testing?</h4>
      <p>
        With Business and Enterprise plans, you can use multiple development
        channels to share different versions of your app with View. For example,
        you can share stable versions of your app with the Marketing department
        to get their feedback on new features, while allowing your QA team to
        test the latest bug fixes on a more recent version.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4 id="faq-deploy-channels">How do Channels work with Deploy?</h4>
      <p>
        When using Deploy to push live updates to your users’ devices, you first
        select the associated Channel and build version. Developer plans are
        restricted to a single channel for live updating with Deploy. Starting
        with the Business plan, you can set up multiple channels and use the
        Deploy service to push live updates of different versions to each
        channel.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li class="item">
      <h4 id="faq-teams">What’s included in the Teams &amp; Organizations feature?</h4>
      <p>
        Teams and organizations allows you to invite development team members,
        testers, and other collaborators, to participate in app development and
        track the progress of your projects. Granular permissions allow Ionic
        Pro administrators to add and remove team members and control who has
        access to which projects.
