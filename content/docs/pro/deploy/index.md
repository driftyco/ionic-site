Ionic Pro's Live Deploy feature let you update the UI and business logic of your app remotely, in real-time. Push HTML, JS, and CSS updates directly to your users without going through the
app store to quickly fix bugs and ship new features.

This enables you to

* Update your application on demand
* Avoid app store publishing for many fixes
* Get new features and bug fixes to your users quickly
* A/B test changes with certain users before rolling them out to everyone

In order to use advanced features such as switching Channels on the fly, Split Testing, Beta Channels, etc, you may have to use some of the [Deploy API](/docs/pro/deploy/plugin-api.html).

## Get started

* [Setup and use the plugin](/docs/pro/deploy/setup/)
* [Advanced Usage with the Deploy API](/docs/pro/deploy/plugin-api.html)
* [Migrate from the legacy Cloud Dashboard](/docs/pro/migration/live-updates.html)
