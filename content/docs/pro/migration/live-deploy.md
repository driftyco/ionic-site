# Migrate from Ionic Cloud Deploy to Ionic Pro Deploy

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">In order to continue deploying live updates to your users, you must migrate to the new Ionic Pro service by following the instructions below. A native binary release (through the app stores, etc) is required for this change.</div>

If you're moving your app from the legacy Ionic Cloud dashboard and want to keep using Ionic Pro Deploy, here's what you need to do.

## Remove the old plugin

`ionic-plugin-deploy` is no longer needed in Ionic Pro, so you can run:

```bash
cordova plugin rm ionic-plugin-deploy
```

## Remove all your old deploy code

Your app probably has code to check for and download updates using the `ionic-cloud-angular` library. You can safely remove all of this code, as the new service works either automatically or directly on the plugin.

## Set up the new plugin

The Ionic Pro services which take advantage of native device features are now centralized in the `cordova-plugin-ionic` plugin.

You'll install it as part of the setup process **[here](/docs/pro/deploy/)**.

If you'd like to use custom Deploy logic, you can use the new [Deploy API](/docs/pro/deploy/plugin-api.html) after installing the plugin without an automatic setting.

## Deploy a New Native Build to the App Stores

Because some native plugins were changed, you will have to resubmit a new native binary to the App Stores or your MDM solution.

## All set!

Congrats, you're done!
