# Migrate from Ionic Cloud

Below you'll find guides and resources to help you get your app moved over from the Ionic Cloud dashboard to the new Ionic Pro service

## Legacy Paid Plans

If you were paying for Ionic Cloud, then your account has been migrated over to the new Ionic Pro dashboard!  You've also been upgraded to the **Developer Tier** at no additional charge.

To start using your new account, just head over to [dashboard.ionicjs.com](https://dashboard.ionicjs.com/apps) and log in with your existing Cloud credentials.

<p class="paid-notice">
  Ionic Pro is a new service, so once you start using the new dashboard, any changes you make to your account may not be reflected on the legacy dashboard.
</p>

## Services to Migrate

Many of the features of Ionic Cloud (along with a whole host of new ones) are integrated into the Pro experience.  Check out these guides to see how they may have changed, and what needs to be done to get set up.
