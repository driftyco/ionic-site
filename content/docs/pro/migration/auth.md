# Ionic Auth is being Shut Down Jan 31st, 2018

Ionic Auth will be shut down and no longer function on January 31st, 2018. To learn more about this shutdown, please read our [blog post](https://blog.ionicframework.com/sunsetting-ionic-cloud-push-and-auth/).

## Migrating off of Ionic Auth

The Ionic community is already using a number of leading push and auth providers today. Here are some linkes & guides on using popular services:

**AWS Cognito** has put together a [guide](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/user-sign-in-and-sign-up-for-ionic-mobile-apps-with-amazon-cognito/) that shows you exactly how to set up the Cognito Auth service with an Ionic project.

**Auth0** is also popular and has put together a [blog post](https://auth0.com/blog/ionic-framework-how-to-get-started/) about using Auth0 with Ionic.

**Firebase** by Google is also widely used as a auth notification service by Ionic users. Check out their docs [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/start). They also have an [Auth tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OKrloDzGpU&list=PLl-K7zZEsYLmnJ_FpMOZgyg6XcIGBu2OX&index=19) in their Firecasts series.

## Migration Questions & Auth Export
