# View

Rather than loading the latest version of your app, Ionic View now has the power to control exactly who sees which versions of your code.  It's been upgraded with a host of powerful beta testing features and integrated deeply into the Ionic Pro dashbaord.

Check out the new View docs [here](/docs/pro/beta-testing.html)!
