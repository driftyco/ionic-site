# Package

In Ionic Pro, the Package service is no longer split off from your centralized code history.  To get started, just follow these steps.

## Upload your credentials

You can upload the same credentials you used for the Cloud dashboard to the Pro dashboard.

You can find instructions for this step [here](/docs/pro/native-builds.html#uploading-your-certs).

## Start generating builds

Performing package builds is even simpler than before.

[Here](/docs/pro/native-builds.html#performing-a-build) are the docs!
