# Live Deployment

Ionic Pro's Live Deploy feature let you update the UI and business logic of your app remotely, in real-time. Push HTML, JS, and CSS updates directly to your users without going through the
app store to quickly fix bugs and ship new features.

This enables you to

* Update your application on demand
* Skip app store approvals
* Get new features and bug fixes to your users quickly
* A/B test changes with certain users before rolling them out to everyone
