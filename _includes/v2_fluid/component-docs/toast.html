_For more details on the Toast component, see the [Toast API reference](../api/components/toast/Toast/)._

Toast is a simple component that allows you display a notification at the bottom of the screen. The toast appears on top of the app's content, and can be dismissed by the app to resume user interaction with the app. It includes a backdrop, which can optionally be clicked to dismiss the toast.

Its also possible to dismiss a Taost from another method within your page.

```typescript

import {Toast} from "ionic-angular";

export class MyPage {

  toast: Toast;
  
  constructor() {
  }

  presentToast() {
    this.toast = Toast.create({
      message: 'User was added successfully',
      duration: 3000
    });

    this.nav.present(this.toast);
  }
  
  // Could be called on click or other interaction
  anotherMethod(){
    (this.toast) ? this.toast.dismiss() : false;
  }

```
