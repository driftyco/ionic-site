Now that you have [Ionic and its dependencies installed](../installation), you can build your first app! This section will guide you through the process of starting a new application, adding pages, navigating between those pages, and more. Let's get started!


### Starting a New Ionic 2 App

Let's create a new app! Use the `start` command to initialize a new Ionic app. Specify that you want it to be an Ionic 2 app by passing in the `--v2` option. We also specify that the `tutorial` template should be used. Ionic 2 applications are created as JavaScript by default, you can change to TypeScript by passing in the `--ts` option.

```bash
$ ionic start MyIonic2Project tutorial --v2
```

This will pull Ionic 2 down, install [npm modules](../../resources/what-is/#npm) for the application, and get [Cordova](../../resources/what-is/#cordova) set up and ready to go.

**Want to use JavaScript instead? Pass the `--no-ts` flag and get a project set up for JavaScript instead.**

> You may have noticed that we passed in **tutorial** to the `ionic start` command. This tells Ionic to initialize your application using the [tutorial template](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-starter-tutorial). If you don't specify a template by running `ionic start MyIonic2Project --v2`, the [tabs template](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic2-starter-tabs) will be used.


### Viewing the app in a browser
Now, you can `cd` into the folder that was created. To get a quick preview of your app in the browser, use the `serve` command.

```bash
$ cd MyIonic2Project/
$ ionic serve
```

You should see the welcome message shown above if everything was installed successfully.

In the next section, let's go over the project structure created by the `ionic start` command.
