# Testing in a Browser

Use `ionic serve` to start a local development server for app dev and testing. This is useful for both desktop browser testing, and to test within a device browser which is connected to the same network. Additionally, this command starts LiveReload which is used to monitor changes in the file system. As soon as you save a file the browser is refreshed automatically. View [Using Sass](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-cli/blob/master/README.md#using-sass) if you would also like to have `ionic serve` watch the project's Sass files.

```bash
$ ionic serve [options]
```

### Service Proxies

The `serve` command can add some proxies to the http server. These proxies are useful if you are developing in the browser and you need to make calls to an external API. With this feature you can proxy request to the external api through the ionic http server preventing the `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource` error.

In the `ionic.project` file you can add a property with an array of proxies you want to add. The proxies are object with two properties:

* `path`: string that will be matched against the beginning of the incoming request URL.
* `proxyUrl`: a string with the url of where the proxied request should go.

```json
{
  "name": "appname",
  "email": "",
  "app_id": "",
  "proxies": [
    {
      "path": "/v1",
      "proxyUrl": "https://api.instagram.com/v1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Using the above configuration, you can now make requests to your local server at `http://localhost:8100/v1` to have it proxy out requests to `https://api.instagram.com/v1`

For example:

```js
angular.module('starter.controllers', [])
.constant('InstagramApiUrl', '')
// .contant('InstagramApiUrl','https://api.instagram.com')
//In production, make this the real URL

.controller('FeedCtrl', function($scope, $http, InstagramApiUrl) {

  $scope.feed = null;

  $http.get(InstagramApiUrl + '/v1/media/search?client_id=1&lat=48&lng=2.294351').then(function(data) {
    console.log('data ' , data)
    $scope.feed = data;
  })

})
```
